The files EDF* are for Explicitly Deweighted Features (EDF).
SaveScript1 is a record of experiments, but using earlier file
structure.  RegAvging.R is for another project.

My qeML package is not yet on CRAN; available at github.com/matloff/qeML

The utilities are in EDF_Misc.R and EDF_CorrrSens.R.  Code for
individual ML methods is in the other files, e.g. EDF_Ridge.R.

General notes:

   The rho values, correlations between predicted values and S (replace
   latter by P(S = 1 | X) for S binary/categorical) are computed by
   corrsens().

   Return values include qeML-style quantities such as testAcc and
   baseAcc.

Notes on specific functions:

   qeFairRidgeLin():

      The 'lambdas' argument is an R list, specifying the lambda values
      for each feature in the C set.  Categorical feature are expanded
      to dummy variables, with the same lambda value for each.

Examplee:

   > z <- qeFairRF(pef,'wageinc',list(occ=0.1),'sex')
   > z$testAcc
   [1] 24005.35
   > z$corrs
         sex 
   0.1431146 

   Here, we predict income from various features (all the remaining
   ones), with S = gender and C = occupation.  The Mean Absolute
   Prediction Error on the holdout set was about $24K, with correlation
   between C and S being about 0.14.  The correlation here was 

      rho[est. P(Y = 1 | X), est. P(S = 1 | X)]

   Occupation was deweighted, so less likely to be in a tree, to 0.1
   (applied to each dummy variable resulting from expanding 'occ').
